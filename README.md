### Udemy Clone - React.js Project

This is a fully responsive Udemy clone built using React.js. The project simulates a typical online course platform, offering features like:

- **Dynamic Course Listings**: Browse various courses with detailed information.
- **Course Enrollment**: Simulated course enrollment functionality.
- **Search Functionality**: Easily search for courses by keywords.
- **User Interface**: Clean, user-friendly interface mimicking Udemyâ€™s layout.

This project demonstrates my skills in front-end development with React, handling dynamic components, state management, and responsive design.
